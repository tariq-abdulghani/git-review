# Git Basics

## Git Terminology
    Working Tree -> Set of files and directories managed by git
    Repository   -> all meta data about the whole changes .
    Commit       -> saved changes at a point of time
    Branch       -> Sequence of commits, and also contains all information about directory
                    and files.

    
## Git Basic Work Flow
    working tree            staging area            Repository

-- Conclusions
    we need to create a repository to save our hisoty

# basic commands
git init 
git status // gets the status of files in the working directory
           // we can also use git status --short  for short status
           // files have 4 possible status values tracked, unmodified, modified, staged.
git diff   // to see what changes occured exactly (working tree vs staged)
git diff --staged //(staged vs last commit)
git add <>
git commit -m""
git log <*option>

# Removing file 
git rm <fname> // removes the file from working dir 
git rm --cached // remove file from staged area but its no longer tracked and its not removed from working tree.

# Git Basics - Viewing the Commit History
git log // shows all commits in chronological order in the repo.
git log --patch | -p  -n? // for change log per commit

# Git Basics - Undoing Things

git commit --amend // used when early commit and forgot some files
                   // modifieS THE LAST COMMIT and adds the staged file to it, as if it never happened
                   // so we have only one commit.

## Unstaging a Staged File
git restore --staged <file-name> // moves the file from staged state to untracked/unmodified state.

## Unmodifying a Modified File with git restore
git restore <file>..." // to discard changes in working directory
                       // revert it back to what it looked like when you last committed.
